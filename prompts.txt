Make me a website for this that has visuals and uses real images like maybe in the background in a visual manor of for example like the bismarack rock etcof Tanzania and mwanza landscape and then this is the actual content and context for the website that should be called "Twende Education Foundation" : üî∑ TWENDE EDUCATION FOUNDATION ‚Äî FULL CONTEXT FOR WEBSITE CREATION Name of Organization: Twende Education Foundation  Founded: May 2025  Overview: Twende Education Foundation is a nonprofit co-founded by seven Ivey Business School students during a teaching trip to Mwanza, Tanzania. It was launched with the mission of improving access to education and empowering youth across East Africa. The foundation began with a $10,000 fundraising goal and has since raised over $13,000 in its first few weeks.  Mission: To create opportunity through education by providing:  Post-secondary scholarships  School supplies and infrastructure improvements for local schools  Support and essential resources for orphanages  Long-term regional expansion across East Africa  Initial Impact (2025):  Fully funded 3 two-year diplomas at St. Augustine University of Tanzania for local high school graduates  Delivered a printer/photocopier, 2 couches, backpacks, 500+ pens and pencils, and more supplies to Bulemeji Secondary School  Supplied the Watoto Wa Africa Orphanage with a washing machine, 50+ textbooks, clothing, food, and other essentials  Values:  Community-driven impact  Long-term sustainability  Equity in education  Direct, transparent action  Founders (7 Co-Founders): Include a section with names, photos, and hometowns of the following seven co-founders:  Kosta Liaskas  Hin Cheung  Adam Ward  Aidan Prosser  Sai Shankar  Julianna Rizzo  Nathan Mark  Donation Link: https://gofund.me/fb1cf0b6  General Contact Email: a7educationfoundation@gmail.com  Future Goals:  Sustain annual scholarship funding  Grow relationships with schools and orphanages  Expand operations to additional countries in East Africa  Notes for Accuracy:  The foundation was created in May 2025  Please ensure all references to the year reflect this (avoid generic or incorrect founding dates)

there needs to be a little more space between the top bar and the empowering line
This is our modo: Twende Pamoja: Let‚Äôs Go Together. We create opportunity through education for Tanzanian youth.it should also say or incorporate this message somewhere in the website preferably the beginning or ealry on: Twende means ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go‚Äù in Swahili - and that‚Äôs exactly what we are doing.  The Twende Education Foundation is a student-led nonprofit born in Tanzania and rooted in a shared mission to create lasting change through education.  Founded by seven students from Ivey Business School (Aidan, Adam, Hin, Julianna, Kosta, Nathan, and Sai) during a service-learning trip to Mwanza, we witnessed firsthand how limited access to education holds back bright, motivated youth. Twende was created to help break that barrier.  We fund scholarships year over year, improve school infrastructure, support orphanages, and provide resources like school supplies and sports equipment - all to expand opportunity and empower students to build their futures.:

Can you change this to say - Twende means ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go‚Äù - and since 2025, we‚Äôve been doing just that, empowering youth in Mwanza and beyond through education.
and i cant see the link/buttons under that because the about section blocks the bottom of the home section
I do not want the about section to block the buttons/links at the bottom of the home section
can you change teh fundrasing success part to say this instead: Launched with an initial goal of $10,000, Twende has now raised over $13,000 ‚Äî a milestone that helped turn a small idea into a fully operational foundation
change this: Launched with an initial goal of $10,000, Twende has now raised over $13,000 ‚Äî a milestone that helped turn a small idea into a fully operational foundation. into this: Launched with an initial goal of $10,000, Twende has now raised over $13,000 - a milestone that helped turn a small idea into a fully operational foundation.
school supplies and infastructure as well for this part: Every dollar donated goes directly towards scholarships, school supplies, and supporting orphanages in Mwanza.
replace with this Twende means ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go‚Äù ‚Äî and since 2025, we‚Äôve been doing just that, empowering youth in Mwanza and beyond through education. for this/instead of this: Founded in 2025 by Ivey Business School students, we're creating opportunities for the next generation in Mwanza and beyond.
change this: Twende means "let's go" - and since 2025, we've been doing just that, empowering youth in Mwanza and beyond through education. Founded by seven Ivey Business School students (Aidan, Adam, Hin, Julianna, Kosta, Nathan, and Sai) during a Lecturing trip at Saint Augustine University of Tanzania, where we witnessed the transformative power of education. We're committed to improving access to education and empowering youth across East Africa through scholarships, school improvements, and community support. instead into this: Founded in May 2025, Twende Education Foundation was launched by seven students from Ivey Business School at Western University during a guest lecturing trip to St. Augustine University of Tanzania, part of the Africa Service Learning program. Over the course of the trip, we taught more than 80 students across undergraduate, master's, and PhD programs using the Ivey Case Method - a discussion-based approach grounded in real-world decision-making and collaborative learning.  Inspired by the students we met and the urgent needs of the community around us, we co-founded Twende ("Let's Go") to expand access to education across East Africa. What began with a $10,000 fundraising goal quickly turned into something more. Together, we raised over $13,000 to launch the foundation and deliver immediate, on-the-ground support.  Working closely with local leadership, we helped design a merit- and need-based scholarship fund and led the strategic planning, fundraising, and execution of our first initiatives. Today, the seven co-founders continue to serve on Twende‚Äôs Executive Board, overseeing operations, financial stewardship, and long-term growth - with a shared commitment to building sustainable impact.  While Twende was always envisioned as a long-term, year-over-year initiative, it‚Äôs the overwhelming support we received that made it truly possible - thank you so much, and we‚Äôre just getting started.
